#### Discussion Forum

The purpose of the async discussion forum is to facilitate a free exchange of ideas.  Remain respectful of other ideas.  Active, relevant and timely discussion is encouraged.  Please refrain from simple replies such as "I agree".

The requirements each week is to both create a post according to the assignment but to also comment in a meaningful way on posts by two other students.

#### Cloud Resources (Labs, Credits, and Accounts)

This course will make sure of several free resources that allow students to use real cloud environments on AWS, Google and Azure.  Please set up accounts as follows:

*   AWS:  Create an account on AWS Educate using your school email account:  [https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/).  This will be where “free” sandboxed AWS Environments will launch. (Note, you are also encouraged to sign up for a “free tier” AWS account:  [https://aws.amazon.com/free/](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
*   GCP:  Create an account on Qwiklabs using your school email account:  [https://www.qwiklabs.com/](https://www.qwiklabs.com/)
*   Azure: Create an account on Azure for students using your school email account:  [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/).
