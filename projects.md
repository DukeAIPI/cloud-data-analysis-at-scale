# Projects

## Projects (Individual)

There are four individual projects.  The deliverables for each project are:

*   Github project with source code and README.md explaining project
*   30 second to one minute Demo video showing how it works.  This demo video should be submitted into group discussion for the week it is due.  This will allow other students to learn from each other and exchange ideas.

### Project #1:  Continuous Delivery of Flask Application on GCP

*   Create a Google App Engine application using GCP Cloud Shell environment
*   Push source code to Github
*   Configure Cloud Build to Deploy Changes on build

### Project #2:  Docker Container Project

*   Create a customized Docker container from the current version of Python that deploys a simple python script.
*   Push image to DockerHub
*   Pull the image down and run it on a cloud platform cloud shell:  Google Cloud Shell or AWS Cloud9.

### Project #3:  Cloud Map Reduce

*   Read Chapter 16 in Python for Programmers and implement it on Azure using a free Azure for education account:  [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/education/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/education/)
*   Port the example to run on either the GCP or AWS cloud

### Project #4:  Serverless Data Engineering Pipeline

*   Reproduce the architecture of the example serverless data engineering project.
*   Enhance the project by extending the functionality of the NLP analysis:  adding entity extraction, key phrase extraction, or some other NLP feature.

### Final Project Description (Team: 3-4)

*   Build a containerized or PaaS machine learning prediction model and deploy it in a scalable, and elastic platform:
    *   Options:
        *   ML Framework
            *   Sklearn, MXNet, PyTorch or Keras/TF
        *   Model
            *   Your own supervised ML prediction model or a Kaggle Prediction Model
        *   Platform
            *   Flask + Kubernetes deployed to EKS (Elastic Kubernetes) or Google Kubernetes Engine
            *   Flask + Google App Engine
            *   AWS Sagemaker
            *   Other (Upon Request)
*   Verify Elastic Scale-Up Performance via Load Test with [Locust](https://locust.io/), [Loader.io](https://loader.io), or a similar load test framework. (Start with 1 container or endpoint) and verify 2 or more inference endpoints scale up to 1K requests per second.
*   Deliverables:
    *   Source code in Github Project with README.md file that explains the project.
    *   Demo video showing project scaling to 1K+ requests served by multiple endpoints that scale-up.   The video should be between **one** to **five** minutes.  Videos over five minutes or under one minute will have points deducted.
    *   **One** to **five** minute in-person class presentation

## (Optional, but recommended:)

* The video should be at least 1080p with 16:9 aspect ratio.
* Consider recording with a  low-cost mic like follows:  https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42/ or equivalent at 48 kHz to 96 kHz.
* Build this into public Github portfolio with links to your videos in YouTube.
