### Demo

* Create and share a 30-90 second (hard capped at 90 seconds) “demo” video explaining your project plan. Looking at the requirements for the final individual project, create a week by week schedule for the next 10 weeks with specific milestones. Use the [spreedsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_TGa3XWgNO9G9n2HH4t02uTRPdXWp72RBlgc-UFtn7Q/edit#gid=0) as a reference. For each week, create a “weekly demo” slot. This is where you will screencast a 90 second demo of your project during this period.
