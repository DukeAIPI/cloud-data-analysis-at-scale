# Effective Async Technical Project Management

## Why Software Projects Fail

It is common for software projects to fail.  Working in the Bay Area over a decade it more common to see failed projects than successful projects.  Here is what most likely goes wrong:

* Lack of automation
* Lack of effective project management process
* HIPPOs (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) and Heros let everyone down.  This is another way of saying *EGO IS THE PROCESS*.
* Lack of effective technical management
* Lack of experience building software that works and is on-time
* Overconfidence
* Failing in love with complexity of any kind
* Lack of teamwork

## How to ship high quality software that works and is on-time

### Exercises 

* Topic: Create technical project plan for final project
* Directions:  

    - Part A:  With your project team, create an approximately 12 week schedule with "two-weeks" of QA built in.  Use a spreadsheet for this.  This means you have to effectively stop creating features and test for the final two weeks.  This equates to 10 weeks of coding max.

    - Part B:  Create a ticket system using [Github](https://github.com/), [Trello](http://trello.com/), or [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).  *Warning...the only thing worth than no ticket system is a ticket system that explodes with so much complexity it is unusable.  This is MUCH worse! Embrace K.I.S.S.*

    - Part C:  Create an internal "weekly demo" schedule and invite team to it.  Make sure it is brief and working code is demo'd each week.  Adjust schedule as you encounter issues.
