**Conduct expectations**

It is the expectation that students, TAs, and the instructor will

regard each other with mutual respect.

Students will abide by the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard):

I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;

I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and

I will act if the Standard is compromised.

The instructor reserves the right to adjust class exam grades (never lower) as he deems appropriate. Your final letter grade will correspond to your weighted average according to the usual scheme:

X− 		X 		X+

A 	90–92.99 	93–96.99 	97–100

B 	80–82.99 	83–86.99 	87–89.99

C 	70–72.99 	73–76.99 	77–79.99

D 	60–62.99 	63–66.99 	67–69.99

F 	< 60
